# Accommodate

Accommodate is a single page application clone of AirBnB. Users can search for listings by location and book a listing on dates that are available. Users can also become hosts and post listings of their own. 

## Technologies Used

Accommodate uses PostgreSQL for a database and is built on a Rails backend with a React-Redux frontend. Other technologies used include Google Maps Api, React-dates, and React-modal.
