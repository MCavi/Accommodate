# Accommodate

Accommodate is a single page application clone of AirBnB. Users can search for listings by location and book a listing on dates that are available. Users can also become hosts and post listings of their own. 

## Technologies Used

Accommodate uses PostgreSQL for a database and is built on a Rails backend with a React-Redux frontend. Other technologies used include Google Maps Api, React-dates, and React-modal. 


## Main Features

### `User Authentication`

Users can create a new account or login if they already have an account. A demo account is also available for use in the login modal.
    
### `Listings Page`

By entering a location and/or choosing filters to apply, users can view all listings that satisfy the requirements.

### `Listing Show Page`

After selecting a listing from the listings page, users will be redirected to the show page for that listing. Here is where users can see more pictures and read important information about the listing.

### `Booking`

Also in the show page users can use the drop down calendar to select the days on which they would like to book the listing.

### `Reviews`

Users can leave a review on a listing that they have previously stayed at.

    
## `Upcoming Features`

Hosts can either approve or deny a users request to book their listing.

Hosts will be able to leave reviews about past renters.
